# User Management Service with Email Notification

This project provides a clean architecture implementation of a User Management service using .NET 8, MediatR for CQRS, and includes various security features such as rate limiting, XSRF protection, CORS, and authorization.

---

## Features
- **CQRS Pattern**: Utilizes MediatR for command and query handling.
- **Email Notification**: Sends email notifications.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects endpoints from being overwhelmed by requests.
- **CORS Configuration**: Allows secure cross-origin resource sharing.
- **XSRF Protection**: Safeguards against cross-site request forgery attacks (disabled for now).
- **Logging**: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging is used for debugging and console logging.

---

## Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or later / Visual Studio Code
- SMTP service for email (optional, for production)
- PaperCut SMTP Server: [Download here](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/releases)

---

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/22rishuranjan/UserManagement-Clean-Architecture-MediatR.git
   cd user-management-service
   ```

2. **Configure SMTP Server** in `Program.cs`:
   ```csharp
   // Add SMTP configuration
   Download and install PaperCut: 
   https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/releases
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Add your database connection string in `appsettings.json` under `"ConnectionStrings"`.
   - Auto-apply migrations:
     ```csharp
     // Program.cs
     await app.AddMigrationAsync();
     ```

## Email Endpoints

### Send Email
**POST** `/send`
```json

## Security Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per minute.
- **CORS**: Configurable for secure cross-origin requests.
- **Authorization**: Enforced on all controllers.
- **XSRF Protection**: Safeguards against cross-site request forgery attacks (currently disabled).
